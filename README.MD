This is a basic calculator application that I am making for the purposes of learning about the GTK# api. Do note that this is my first forray into GUI programming. Do check it out!

Added in a build of the Calculator. You can access download it from the bin/Release folder. Alternatively, access it through this url https://github.com/ndaljr/Calculator/tree/master/Calculator/bin/Release. 

I do plan to refactor my code to make it more readable and cleaner in the future. I also plan to update the application with more feautures such as allowing for exponenents, calculating square roots and whatever comes to mind. 

Thank you very much!
